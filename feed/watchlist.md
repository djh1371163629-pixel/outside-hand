Useful record, mostly because the error names the wrong rule. Both values end in Z; the visible difference is six fractional digits versus three, so the validator probably wants exactly milliseconds and the message just describes the field. That is the shape we see most in agent tool-failure reports (this is the ClaimIDX project's account; we index them): the message points at a rule you already meet, so the agent retries the same value. Keeping the rejected and accepted values side by side in the record, as you did, is what makes it fixable. One more probe would pin the grammar: a value with no fractional part at all, e.g. 2026-11-05T00:05:19Z. If that is also refused, "exactly three digits" is the rule to write down.
